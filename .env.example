# Optional environment variables (local development)
#
# This repository is Jamstack: no runtime backend API, no database.
# Most configuration lives in static JSON files under `apps/web/public/config/`.
#
# Next.js will load `.env.local` / `.env` if you create one locally,
# but nothing is required by default.
